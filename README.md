This repository contains a research project titled “A Study on Comparative Analysis of Indexed Mutual Funds in Indian Stock Market”, carried out as part of the PGDM curriculum at Ramaiah Institute of Management Studies (RIMS), Bangalore.

📌 Project Overview

The project investigates the performance, risk-return profile, and comparative analysis of small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap indexed mutual funds in the Indian stock market. It provides insights into how different categories of funds behave under varying market conditions, offering valuable takeaways for retail and institutional investors.

🏦 Companies / Funds Analyzed

The study examines multiple mutual funds and asset management companies across categories:

Small-Cap Funds

Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd

UTI Asset Management

Mid-Cap Funds

Axis Bank Ltd

ITI Ltd

Large-Cap Funds

HDFC Bank Ltd

Invesco Ltd

🎯 Objectives of the Study

To understand the concept and evolution of mutual funds in India.

To evaluate the risk-return tradeoff across fund categories.

To compare indexed fund performance vs. market benchmarks (Sensex, Nifty).

To identify factors influencing fund selection by investors.

To provide findings and suggestions for investors and policymakers.

📑 Methodology

Research Design: Descriptive and analytical.

Data Sources: Secondary data from published reports, mutual fund fact sheets, NSE/BSE data.

Tools Used:

Return & risk analysis (standard deviation, beta, alpha.)

Hypothesis testing (T-test)

Graphical comparisons (risk-return scatter plots, yearly performance trends).

📈 Key Findings

Small-cap funds show higher risk but potential for higher returns.

Mid-cap funds provide a balanced growth trajectory.

Large-cap funds are safer with consistent but moderate returns.

Index funds closely track their respective benchmarks but may underperform due to tracking errors and fund expenses.

💡 Suggestions

Investors should align fund selection with risk appetite and investment horizon.

Diversification across small, mid, and large-cap categories is recommended.

Regulatory focus on lowering costs and ensuring transparency can improve investor confidence.
